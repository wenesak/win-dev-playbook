# Win dev playbook

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Windows machine and
my WSL development environtment on that machine. It uses Ansible from within a WSL environment to
both update the WSL environment itself as well as it's Windows host.

Some things in Windows are slightly difficult to automate,
so I still have some manual installation steps, but at least it's  going to be all documented here.

This is a work in progress, and is mostly a means for me to document my current Windows's /WSL setup.
I'll be evolving this set of playbooks over time.

## Upgrade to Ansible 2.10 and higher

Don't!. No serious ;) First uninstall Ansible 2.9 or lower. Upgrading does not
work.

Install ansible 2.10 and higer  with:

```shell
pip install ansible-base
pip install ansible
```
There is no need to do this as root!
Ansible will be installed in a hidden directory. It's bin directory should be
added to your path in your shell configuration, e.g. .bashrc or .zshrc or
whatever shell you fancy. Changes will only be active if your do a `source
.bashrc`, `source .zshrc` or restart your shell.

Check with:

```
which ansible
```
